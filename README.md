- `documentation/` - Database and route docs

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- MySQL running locally or remotely
- npm installed

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/R-JDiaz/e-commerce
cd e-commerce-app
```

### 2. Set up the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/` with your database and server settings:

```env
BACKEND_PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=e-commerce
```

### 3. Run the backend

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend starts the database initialization, migrations, and seeds automatically on launch.

### 4. Set up the frontend

Open a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 5. Run the frontend

```bash
npm start
```

Open the app at `http://localhost:4200`.
